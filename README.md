# Who Am I? (Game) by Almicke "Mickey" Navarro (with the mentoring of Isaiah Discipulo)
* A web-based application that allows players to play a personalized version of "Guess Who?" in a private game room with a chat 

## Introduction
* With the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent a majority of their time in quarantine. This brought about loneliness, depression, and lack of social interactions. In order to help this effort, I decided to create an online game application for my Senior Capstone. Seeing as though there is no current online, personalized "Guess Who?" game, I decided to create one.

## Requirements
* Functional Requirements
  - User can create a new game 
  - User can 
* Non-Functional Requirements
 - HTTP/CSS will be used to make the user interface colorful, organized, and user-friendly.
 - Bootstrap will be used to create a responsive user interface.
 - WebSocket will be used to create private game rooms.
 - STOMP will be used to send messages to other user(s).
 - JavaScript will be used to dynamically build the forms and gameboards. 
 - JavaScript will be used to instantiate the use of WebSocket and STOMP.
 
## Technologies
* Java Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service.
* JavaScript is a programming language used to add dynamic and interactive elements to the application. 
* WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. 
* STOMP(Simple Text Orientated Messaging Protocol) is a simple protocol that allows the client and server to communicate with each other. 
* Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)/Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are two of the core technologies used to build the layout and structure of a web page. 
* Bootstrap is an open-source front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. 
* Eclipse for Java is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supported by IBM.
* Oracle JDK 8 is a development environment for building applications in Java. 

## Technical Approach 

## Risks & Challenges

## Outstanding Issues


## Potentional Additions


## Cloud Computing 
* Currently, this application is not yet available in the cloud. However, I do plan to deploy it to the Cloud when I fix my outstanding issues and add my potentional additions. With the help of my mentor, Isaiah Discipulo, I believe I will be able to accomplish that. I plan to potentially use either Heroku or Azure as my Cloud Provider because I was fortunate enough to gain experience in these specific Clouds.
